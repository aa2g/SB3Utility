# SB3Utility
## Steps to building
1. Run `setup.bat` before you do *anything*. This will copy over some precompiled binaries into your bin folder, but will not run on it's own.
2. Open the solution and build it. If you can't build SB3UtilityFBX, unload it. It's already provided in the precompiled binaries, but you'll have to change the references in the other projects.
